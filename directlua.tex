\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Give definitions of presheaves, sheaves, stalks.
\end{itemize}


\section{Locally constant sheaves}

\begin{itemize}
\item Give definition.
\item Explain sources of examples (and their usefulness): constant sheaves
(duh), direct images (sometimes), sheaves of solutions of differential
equations; and of course examples induced by covering spaces, representations
of the fundamental groupoid, and vector bundles with flat connection.
\item Explain the equivalence of locally constant sheaves and covering spaces;
also discuss how~$f^*$ and~$f_*$ look in this picture.
\item Explain the equivalence of locally constant sheaves and representations
of the fundamental groupoid. Calculate examples of the induced representation,
for instance with the sheaf~$\{ f \,|\, f' = \frac{1}{2z} f \}$
on~$\mathbb{C}^\times$ (which has monodromy~$f \mapsto -f$). Also explain how
to restrict on representations of the fundamental group at some fixed base
point (find out the technical hypotheses needed for this).
\item Explain the equivalence of locally constant sheaves and vector bundles
with flat connection. Warn that a visual representation of a vector bundles
necessarily lives in~$\mathbb{R}^3$ and thus, somewhat unfortunately, comes
with an induced connection.
\end{itemize}


\section{Direct images}

\begin{itemize}
\item Give the definition.
\item Explain how to easily calculate the stalks of the direct image in case
the map in question was closed. Explain how this is related to ``proper base
change''. Explain why closedness is intuitively necessary. Of course, give
\url{https://www2.math.uni-paderborn.de/fileadmin/Mathematik/People/wedhorn/Lehre/SkriptMannigfaltigkeiten.pdf}
as a reference.
\item Give description in terms of generators and relations (in the case that
this should turn out to be helpful).
\end{itemize}


\section{Sheaf cohomology and higher direct images}

\subsection{Basic definition and properties}

\begin{defn}Let~$\E$ be a sheaf of abelian groups on a topological space~$X$.
Then the \emph{$n$-th cohomology of~$X$ with values in~$\E$} is the abelian
group $H^n(X, \E) \defeq R^n\Gamma_X(\E)$, \ie the value of the~$n$-th right
derived functor of the global sections functor~$\Gamma_X : \AbSh(X) \to \Ab$.
\end{defn}

Unrolling the definitions, the sheaf cohomology~$H^n(X,\E)$ is the cohomology
of the cochain complex~$\Gamma_X(\I^\bullet)$, where~$0 \to \E \to \I^0 \to \I^1
\to \cdots$ is a resolution of~$\E$ by injective objects. However, this
description is rarely useful in practice. We will discuss techniques for
calculating sheaf cohomology below.

\begin{ex}$H^0(X,\E) \cong \E(X)$.\end{ex}

With singular or simplicial cohomology, the choice of a coefficient ring does
not matter much in many applications; there is always the universal coefficient
theorem relating~$\Z$-valued cohomology with cohomology with values in other
rings. \emph{This is decidely not so with sheaf cohomology.} Sheaf cohomology
is as much about the topological space as it is about the sheaf in question.
The sheaf cohomology groups depend hugely on the used sheaf.

Unfortunately, there is no useful intuition about sheaf cohomology along the
ways of ``closed cochains modulo exact cochains''. Instead, some intuition on
what the elements of the sheaf cohomology groups look like can be gained by
ÄŒech methods (see below).

The basic proposition about sheaf cohomology is that short exact sequences of
sheaves induce long exact sequences in cohomology.

\begin{prop}Let~$X$ be a topological space. Let~$0 \to \E \to \F \to \G \to 0$
be a short exact sequence of sheaves of abelian groups on~$X$. (This means that
the induced sequences~$0 \to \E_x \to \F_x \to \G_x \to 0$ on stalks are exact
for all points~$x \in X$.) Then there is a natural long exact sequence
\[ 0 \to \E(X) \to \F(X) \to \G(X) \to
  H^1(X,\E) \to H^1(X,\F) \to H^1(X,\G) \to H^2(X,\E) \to \cdots. \]
\end{prop}


\subsection{Relation to ordinary cohomology}

\begin{prop}Let~$X$ be a locally contractible space. Let~$R$ be a ring
and~$\underline{R}$ be the constant sheaf with stalks~$R$. Then
$H^\bullet_\text{sing}(X, R) \cong H^\bullet(X, \underline{R})$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}See~\cite{cibotaru}.
\end{proof}

\textbf{XXX}: Include comparison theorem with cohomology with values in local
systems.


\subsection{Why sheaf cohomology?}

Sheaf cohomology can be motived from many different angles.

\subsubsection*{The Leray spectral sequence} If~$f : X \to Y$ is any continuous map,
the cohomology of~$X$,~$Y$, and the fibers of~$f$ are related. The
Leray spectral sequence expresses this relationship in a precise way,
describing how the cohomology of~$X$ is composed by the cohomology of~$Y$ and
the cohomology of the fibers. However, even if one is only interested in the
cohomology of~$X$ with values in~$\Z$ or in a field, the cohomology of
non-constant sheaves appears in the spectral sequence. Only in special cases,
such that~$f$ is a fibration, does cohomology with values in local systems suffice.

\subsubsection*{Global sections} In complex and algebraic geometry, one is often
interested in the space of global sections of a sheaf~$\E$. For instance, in
the case that~$\E = \O_X(D)$ is the line bundle associated to a divisor~$D$ on a
complex manifold or scheme~$X$, $H^0(X,\E)$ is the space of meromorphic
functions on~$X$ with zeroes and poles behaviour governed by~$D$. However, this
space, or even its dimension, is hard to compute. Therefore one turns to the
\emph{Euler characteristic} of~$\E$, the alternating sum
\[ \chi(X,\E) \defeq \dim H^0(X,\E) - \dim H^1(X,\E) + \dim H^2(X,\E) \pm
\cdots \]
in which the global sections dimension appears as the first summand. This
quantity is in general easier to compute, since it is additive in short exact
sequences (if~$0 \to \E \to \F \to \G \to 0$ is exact, then~$\chi(X,\F) =
\chi(X,\E) + \chi(X,\G)$) and constant in certain families. Obviously,
sheaf cohomology is needed to define the Euler characteristic.

\subsubsection*{Classifying geometric objects} For certain choices of the sheaf, sheaf
cohomology classifies geometric objects. For instance, if~$X$ is a complex
manifold,~$H^1(X,\O_X^\times)$ classifies complex line bundles on~$X$ up to
isomorphism. Here,~$\O_X^\times$ is the sheaf of nowhere vanishing holomorphic
functions. More generally,~$H^1(X,\mathcal{A}ut(\E))$ classifies sheaves which
are locally isomorphic to a fixed sheaf~$\E$ and~$H^1(X,\G)$
classifies~$\G$-torsors on~$X$.

\subsubsection*{Irreducible spaces} The singular cohomology of irreducible topological
spaces -- spaces which cannot be written as the nontrivial union of two proper
closed subsets -- is always zero (in positive degrees). This is not a problem
when working with manifolds, which are irreducible only in the one-point case.
But it is a problem in algebraic geometry, where schemes with their Zariski
topology are often irreducible. For such cases, one is forced to look at
cohomology with values in non-constant sheaves.


\subsection{Higher direct images}

\begin{defn}Let~$f : X \to Y$ be a continuous map. Let~$\E$ be a sheaf of
abelian groups on~$X$. Then the \emph{$n$-th higher direct image of~$\E$
under~$f$} is the sheaf~$R^n f_*(\E)$ of abelian groups on~$Y$.\end{defn}

In this definition, $f_* : \AbSh(X) \to \AbSh(Y)$ denotes the left-exact
pushforward functor and~$R^n f_* : \AbSh(X) \to \AbSh(Y)$ its~$n$-th right
derived functor.

\begin{ex}$R^0 f_*(\E) \cong f_*(\E)$.\end{ex}

\begin{ex}Sheaf cohomology is a special case of higher direct images: Let~$f : X
\to \pt$ be the unique map to the one-point space. Then~$H^n(X,\E) \cong R^n
f_*(\E)$ for any sheaf~$\E$ of abelian groups on~$X$.\end{ex}

For general maps~$f : X \to Y$, the higher direct image can be pictured as a
kind of ``relativized'' sheaf cohomology. To be more specific, we have the
following results.

\begin{prop}Let~$f : X \to Y$ be a continuous map. Let~$\E$ be a sheaf of
abelian groups on~$X$. Then~$R^n f_*(\E)$ is the sheafification of the
presheaf~$U \mapsto H^n(f^{-1}[U], \E)$ on~$X$.\end{prop}

\begin{proof}See \cite[Lemma~\stackhref{01E4}]{stacks-project}.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Proper base change theorem]Let~$X$ be a topological space such
that every open subspace is paracompact (\eg let~$X$ be a manifold). Let~$Y$ be
a Hausdorff space. Let~$f : X \to Y$ be a closed continuous map. Let~$\E$ be a
sheaf of abelian groups on~$X$. Then~$(R^n f_*(\E))_y \cong H^n(f^{-1}[y],
\E|_{f^{-1}[y]})$ for any point~$y \in Y$.\end{thm}

\begin{proof}See \cite[Thm.~8.11]{wedhorn}.\end{proof}

In the statement, the restriction~$\E|_{f^{-1}[y]}$ is defined as the pullback
of~$\E$ under the inclusion map~$i' : f^{-1}[y] \to X$ of the fiber in the
total space.

The proper base change theorem is very useful for visualizing the higher direct
image sheaves. The labeling ``base change'' is because the theorem can also be
formulated in the following way: Consider the pullback (fiber product) diagram
\[ \xymatrix{
  f^{-1}[y] \ar@{^{(}->}[r]^{i'} \ar[d]_{f'} & X \ar[d]^f \\
  \pt \ar@{^{(}->}[r]_i & Y.
} \]
Then $i^* R^n f_*(\E) \cong R^n f'_*(i'^*\E)$, since pulling back along~$i$ is
the same as calculating the stalk at~$y$ (example~\textbf{XXX}).

There is also a more general base change theorem, valid for maps~$i : Y' \to Y$
which are not necessarily the inclusion of a point.

\textbf{XXX}: $R^q f_*(\E) = 0 \Rightarrow H^n(X,\E) \cong H^n(Y,f_*(\E))$.


\section{ÄŒech methods}

\begin{prop}Let~$X$ be a topological space. Let~$\U = (U_i)_i$ be an open
covering of~$X$. Let~$\E$ be a sheaf of abelian groups
on~$X$. Assume that~$\E$ is acyclic on the intersections~$U_{i_0 \cdots i_p}$,
that is~$H^q(U_{i_0 \cdots i_p}, \E) = 0$ for all~$p \geq 0$ and~$q > 0$.
Then~$H^n(X,\E) \cong \check H^n(\U,\E)$ for all~$n \geq 0$.\end{prop}

\begin{proof}The~$E_2$ page of the ÄŒech-to-derived functor spectral sequence of
Proposition~\textbf{XXX} is concentrated in the row~$q = 0$. Therefore the
spectral sequence degenerates. This implies the statement.
\end{proof}


\subsection{The Mayer--Vietoris sequence from a higher point of view}

\begin{prop}Let~$X = A \cup B$ be a covering of a topological space~$X$
by two open subsets. Let~$\E$ be a sheaf of abelian groups on~$X$. Then there
is a Mayer--Vietoris sequence
\[ \cdots \lra H^n(X, \E) \lra
  H^n(A, \E) \oplus H^n(B, \E) \lra
  H^n(A \cap B, \E) \stackrel{\partial}{\lra} H^{n+1}(X, \E) \lra \cdots. \]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}Consider the ÄŒech-to-derived functor spectral sequence for the
given open covering~$\U$. Since~$\U$ consists only of two open sets, its~$E_2$ page looks like this:
\begin{itemize}
\item $E_2^{pq}$ is zero for $p \geq 2$.
\item $E_2^{0q}$ equals the kernel of the map $H^q(A,\E) \oplus H^q(B,\E) \to H^q(A
\cap B,\E)$ which sends $(s,t)$ to $t|_{A \cap B} - s|_{A \cap B}$. (Use the
alternating ÄŒech complex.)
\item $E_2^{1q}$ is the cokernel of that map.
\end{itemize}
Therefore the spectral sequence degenerates on the~$E_2$ page. Now
consider, for any $n \geq 0$, the canonical short exact sequence
\[ 0 \longrightarrow F^1 E_\infty^n \longrightarrow E_\infty^n
\longrightarrow E_\infty^n/F^1 E_\infty^n \longrightarrow 0. \]
Since~$F^2 E_\infty^n = F^3 E_\infty^n = \cdots = 0$ and~$F^0 E_\infty^n =
F^{-1} E_\infty^n = \cdots = E_\infty^n$ (by the vanishing of most
columns, see for instance~\cite{greenberg}),
we can express the outer terms of this sequence in~$E_2$ terms:
\[ 0 \longrightarrow E_2^{1,n-1} \longrightarrow E_\infty^n
\longrightarrow E_2^{0,n} \longrightarrow 0. \]
Explicitly, this is the sequence
\begin{align*}
  0 &\longrightarrow \mathrm{cok}(H^{n-1}(A) \oplus H^{n-1}(B) \to
H^{n-1}(A \cap B)) \\
  &\longrightarrow H^n(X) \\
  &\longrightarrow \mathrm{ker}(H^n(A) \oplus H^n(B) \to H^n(A \cap B)) \\
  &\longrightarrow 0.
\end{align*}
We can splice these short exact sequences to obtain the long exact
Mayer--Vietoris sequence.
\end{proof}

\begin{itemize}
\item Give the definition (of the ordered ÄŒech complex).
\item Give lemma that ÄŒech cohomology = sheaf cohomology. Sketch the very basic
idea of the proof.
\item Also give lemma that sheaf cohomology = singular cohomology. Again,
sketch the first step of the proof. Link to the very detailed reference
\url{http://www3.nd.edu/~lnicolae/sheaves_coh.pdf}. Also check out

\url{http://mathoverflow.net/questions/4214/equivalence-of-grothendieck-style-versus-cech-style-sheaf-cohomology}.
\item Explain how Mayer--Vietoris is a special case of the ÄŒech-to-sheaf
spectral sequence.
\end{itemize}



\section*{Locally constant sheaves}

\begin{ex}\label{twistarsch}
Consider $S^1$ together with the locally constant sheaf of typical stalk $\Z^2$ and monodromy representation $[\gamma].(a,b)=(b,a)$ where $[\gamma]$ is a generator of $\pi_1S^1$. We want to calculate its sheaf cohomology via cohomology with local coefficient system. The bundle of coefficients $E$ is given as $$E:=[0,1]\times\Z^2/\sim$$ with the identification $(0,(a,b))\sim (1,[\gamma].(a,b))=(1,(b,a))$ and the obvious projection $E\to S^1$. We want to apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to the standard decomposition $S^1=D^+\union D^-$ of $S^1$ into two open intervals yielding the exactness of
\[\begin{xy}
  \xymatrix{
  H^{k-1}(D^+,E)\oplus H^{k-1}(D^-,E)\ar[r] & H^{k-1}(D^+\intersection D^-,E)\ar[r] & H^k(S^1,E)\ar[r] & H^k(D^+,E)\oplus H^k(D^-,E)
  } 
  \end{xy}\]
On a simply connected space a local system of coefficients is globally constant and this shows that $H^k(S^1,E)=0$ for $k>1$. For $k=1$ the sequence becomes
\begin{align}\label{arsch}
\begin{xy}
  \xymatrix{
  H^0(D^+,E)\oplus H^0(D^-,E)\ar[r]\ar[d] & H^0(D^+\intersection D^-,E)\ar[r]\ar[d] & H^1(S^1,E)\ar[r] & 0\\
  \Z^2\oplus\Z^2\ar[r] & \Z^2\oplus\Z^2 & & 
  }
  \end{xy}
\end{align}
We have to identify the lower arrow.\newline

For an arbitrary space $X$ a cochain representing a class in $H^0(X,E)$ assigns to every point $x\in X$ a value in the corresponding fibre $E_x$. The cochain condition means that this value is constant on connected components of $X$. There are no nontrivial coboundaries in this dimension. Therefore we have a very clear understanding of how the groups in the diagram \ref{arsch} are isomorphic to $\Z^k$ namely by evaluation at some fixed points:
\begin{align}\label{arsch2}
  \xymatrix{
  H^0(D^+,E)\oplus H^0(D^-,E)\ar[r]\ar[d]_{\ev_{0.5}}^{\ev_{0.5}} & H^0(D^+\intersection D^-,E)\ar[r]\ar[d]^{\ev_{0.1}\oplus\ev_{0.5}} & H^1(S^1,E)\ar[r] & 0\\
  \Z^2\oplus\Z^2\ar[r] & \Z^2\oplus\Z^2 & & 
  }
\end{align}
Consider the cohomology class in $H^0(D^+,E)$ represented by the cocycle which maps $0.5\mapsto (a,b)\in\Z^2$. This cocycle restricted to $D^+$ also maps $0.1$ to $(a,b)$ because both of these points lie in the same connected component of $D^+$. Thus under isomorphisms \ref{arsch2} the restriction homomorphism $H^0(D^+,E)\to H^0(D^+\intersection D^-,E)$ maps $(a,b)\mapsto ((a,b),(a,b))$.
On the other hand the cohomology class in $H^0(D^-,E)$ represented by the cocycle which maps $0.5\mapsto (c,d)\in\Z^2$ maps $0.1\mapsto (d,c)$ since we have to let the monodromy act first. Therefore the restriction homomorphism $H^0(D^-,E)\to H^0(D^+\intersection D^-,E)$ maps $(c,d)\mapsto ((d,c),(c,d))$.
Mere calculation shows that the cokernel of $H^0(D^+,E)\oplus H^0(D^-,E)\to H^0(D^+\intersection D^-,E)$ is isomorphic to $\Z$ yielding $$H^1(S^1,E)\cong\Z\text{.}$$
\end{ex}


\section*{Direct Images}
\begin{ex}\label{twosheet}
Consider the $2$-sheeted covering $p:S^1\to S^1,z\to z^2$ viewing $S^1\subset\C$. We want to describe the direct image $p_*\underline{\Z}$ of the constant sheaf $\underline{\Z}$. The sheaf $p_*\underline{\Z}$ is locally constant hence it is determined by its monodromy representation $\pi_1S^1=\Z\curvearrowright\Z^2$. The curve $\gamma:[0,2\pi]\to S^1, t\mapsto\exp(i t)$ is a generator of $\pi_1S^1$ and we want to find a lift of this curve $I\to p_*\underline{\Z}$ to the Ã©talÃ© space of $p_*\underline{Z}$ with any given initial condition $\tilde{\gamma}(0)\in p_*\underline{\Z}_0$:

$$\begin{xy}
  \xymatrix{
  & p_*\underline{\Z}\ar[d]^{\pi}\\
  I\ar[r]_{\gamma}\ar[ru]^{\tilde{\gamma}} & S^1
  }
\end{xy}$$
\end{ex}
We choose two trivialisations
$$\begin{xy}
  \xymatrix{
p_*\underline{\Z}S^1\setminus\{+1\}=\underline{\Z}p^{-1}S^1\setminus\{+1\}=\underline{\Z}S^1\setminus\{\pm 1\}\ar[r]^/1.25cm/{\phi} & \Z_{upper}\oplus\Z_{lower}\\
p_*\underline{\Z}S^1\setminus\{-1\}=\underline{\Z}p^{-1}S^1\setminus\{-1\}=\underline{\Z}S^1\setminus\{\pm i\}\ar[r]^/1.25cm/{\psi} & \Z_{left}\oplus\Z_{right}
  }
\end{xy}$$
where for instance one generator of $\Z_{upper}$ corresponds to the locally constant real-valued function taking the value $+1$ on the upper connected arc of $S^1\setminus\{\pm 1\}$ and vanishing on the lower one.\newline

\vspace{1cm}

Let us describe the lift $\tilde{\gamma}$ with the initial condition $\tilde{\gamma}(0)=[\psi^{-1}(1,0)]_1$. At time $t=\pi-\varepsilon$ this lift still has the value $[\psi^{-1}(1,0)]_{\gamma(\pi-\varepsilon)}$ and we claim:
\begin{align}
\tilde{\gamma}(\pi-\varepsilon)&=[\psi^{-1}(1,0)]_{\gamma(\pi-\varepsilon)}\\
&=[\phi^{-1}(0,1)]_{\gamma(\pi-\varepsilon)}\label{claim}
\end{align}
The point $\tilde{\gamma}(\pi-\varepsilon)$ is obtained as follows: consider the locally constant real-valued function $f\in p_*\underline{\Z}(S^1\setminus\{-1\})=\underline{\Z}(S^1\setminus\{\pm i\})$ having the value $1$ on the left arc and $0$ on the right one. This is a section of $p_*\underline{\Z}$ over the open set $S^1\setminus\{-1\}$. The preimage of $\gamma(\pi-\varepsilon)$ consists of the two points $\exp\left(\frac{i(\pi-\varepsilon)}{2}\right)$ and $\exp\left(\frac{i(3\pi-\varepsilon)}{2}\right)$:\vspace{1cm}

On the other hand the real-valued function $g:=\phi^{-1}(0,1)\in p_*\underline{\Z}(S^1\setminus\{+1\})=\underline{\Z}(S^1\setminus\{\pm 1\})$ having the value $0$ on the upper arc and $1$ on the lower one represents exactly the same stalk of $p_*\underline{\Z}$ at the point $\gamma(\pi-\varepsilon)$. This proves claim (\ref{claim}).

A similar argument shows
\begin{align*}
\tilde{\gamma}(2\pi-\varepsilon)&=[\phi^{-1}(0,1)]_{\gamma(2\pi-\varepsilon)}\\
&=[\psi^{-1}(0,1)]_{\gamma(2\pi-\varepsilon)}
\end{align*}
and then $\tilde{\gamma}(2\pi)=[\psi^{-1}(1,0)]_1$. Together with a similar calculation on the other generator of the stalk at $1$ we conclude that in the monodromy representation $\pi_1S^1\curvearrowright\Z^2$ the generator of $\pi_1S^1$ interchanges the two summands of $\Z^2$ -- the stalk of $p_*\underline{\Z}$ at the point $1\in S^1$.


\section*{The Serre Spectral Sequence}
\begin{ex}Every covering is a fibration and hence yields a Serre spectral sequence converging to the cohomology of the total space. Revisiting Example \ref{twosheet} we observe that every preimage of a point consists of two discrete points and hence alle higher direct images $R^ip_*\underline{\Z},i>0$ vanish. Therefore the Serre spetral sequence looks as follows:\\
\begin{sseq}[grid=none,labelstep=1,entrysize=1.8cm,xlabels={0;;1;;2}]{0...4}{0...1}
\ssdrop{H^0(S^1,p_*\underline{\Z})}\ssmove{2}{0}
\ssdrop{H^1(S^1,p_*\underline{\Z})}\ssmove{2}{0}
\ssdrop{H^2(S^1,p_*\underline{\Z})}\ssmove{2}{0}
\end{sseq}\\
Thus the $E_2$ page equals the limiting page $E_{\infty}$ and we have an isomorphism $$H^k(S^1,p_*\underline{\Z})\cong H^k(S^1,\Z)$$ for any $k\geq 0$. The left hand side expression is sheaf cohomology and the right hand one may be interpreted as singular cohomology with coefficients in $\Z$.

For $k=0$ this is obvious since $H^0(S^1,p_*\underline{\Z})=\Gamma p_*\underline{\Z}=\Z$. For $k>0$ this is some statement about the singular cohomology of $S^1$ with local coefficient system $p_*\underline{\Z}$ of typical fibre $\Z^2$ (cf. \ref{twistarsch}).
\end{ex}

\begin{ex} Let $M=S^n$ and $$S^{n-1}\hookrightarrow SM\to S^n$$ its unit sphere bundle. We want to calculate the integral homology of $SM$. The $E^2$ entries are\\
\begin{sseq}[grid=none,labelstep=1,entrysize=1.0cm,xlabels={0;;n-1},ylabels={0;;n}]{0...2}{0...2}
\ssdrop{\Z}\ssmove{2}{0}
\ssdrop{\Z}\ssmove{0}{2}
\ssdrop{\Z}\ssmove{-2}{0}
\ssdrop{\Z}\ssmove{0}{2}
\end{sseq}\\
